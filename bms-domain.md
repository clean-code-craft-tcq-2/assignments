# Battery Monitoring Systems

Electric Vehicles have BMS - Battery Management Systems

[Here is an article that helps to understand the need for BMS](https://circuitdigest.com/article/battery-management-system-bms-for-electric-vehicles)

[Wikipedia gives an idea of the types and topologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_management_system)

[This site gives the optimum Charging-temperature limits](https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_at_high_and_low_temperatures)

[This abstract suggests a range for the optimum State of Charge](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352484719310911)

[Here is a reference for the maximum charge rate](https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/electronic_components/battery-technology/li-ion-lithium-ion-charging.php#:~:text=Constant%20current%20charge:%20In%20the%20first%20stage%20of,rate%20of%20a%20maximum%20of%200.8C%20is%20recommended.)

## Possible purpose

- Protect batteries while charging:
at home, in public place, within vehicle / regenerative braking
- Estimate life, inventory and supply chains

## The Starting Point

We will explore the charging phase of Li-ion batteries to start with.

## The Exploration

How well does our code hold-out in the rapidly evolving EV space?
Can we add new functionality without disturbing the old?

## The Landscape

- Limits may change based on new research
- Technology changes due to obsolescence
- Sensors may be from different vendors with different accuracy
- Predicting the future requires Astrology!

## Keep it Simple

Shorten the Semantic distance

- Procedural to express sequence
- Functional to express relation between input and output
- Object oriented to encapsulate state with actions
- Apect oriented to capture repeating aspects
