# Code with tests, then hand-over

In this project, you will write code, handover and work on another person's code. 

- Readability = Ease and speed of handover
- Ability to refactor and extend = Final deliverable

## Part 1: Preprocess and standardize

Preprocess and send: Receive data from sensors (simulate them). Process and send **standardized data** on the console.

You are free to choose any standard (csv, json, etc) and define the semantics on top of it.
Make sure the choice of standard and semantics are visible in your test cases.

Setup GitHub workflows to build and run. Make sure the GitHub Action passes with maximum possible coverage.

## Part 2: Exchange

You'll get the GitHub username of the person who will take over your code. Add as an admin to your repository.
Similarly, you will take over another repository.

## Part 3: 

After taking over, take the **standardized data** from console and compute basic statistics.
