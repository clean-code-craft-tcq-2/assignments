**Week 4**: Reduce complexity of legacy code

[Recognize abstractions and (single) responsibility](functional.md) by reducing cyclomatic complexity and duplication.

[Extend and Refactor](extend-refactor.md) the previous assignment

**Week 6**: Coverage Assessment using Strategy pattern

Mid-course assessment - [summary and grading criteria](type-wise-inference.md)

**Week 7**: Propose tests to guide Development

Why TDD: Recognize the challenge in big-bang specifications

[Specify daily situations](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAANAAY-7brxUNFVOWklBSFA2MERUVk5RNDdDRUNJT1dGSy4u)

**Week 8**: TDD first step (start with the simplest test)

[Define 'done', one step at a time](tdd-current-ranges.md). Establish quality parameters. Start the solution with a first test

[Starter repo](https://github.com/clean-code-craft-tcq-1/test-driven-ranges), continue 3 weeks

**Week 9**: Drive the solution via Tests

[Repeat](tdd-current-ranges.md): Complete the solution by writing tests on the previous assignment

**Week 10**: Test Driven Extensions on Legacy

[Test-driven addition](tdd-add-func.md) on top of legacy

We have done TDD on new code. Let's now try it on code that's not-so-clean.

**Week 11**: Sender project start

[Project simulation](streaming-project.md): Write code for others, extend others code

Starting point for Sender: [Streaming BMS Data](https://github.com/clean-code-craft-tcq-1/bms-stream)

**Week 12**: Sender project complete, exchange for developing the Receiver
